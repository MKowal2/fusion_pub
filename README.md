# Gene Fusion Analysis

Code to analyze the output of multiple gene fusion finding tools (fusioncatcher, starfusion, arriba, tophat) on multiple cell lines taken from different datasets. 
The data was removed due to possible identification of people from their fusion data. 

Work done in collaberation with the BHK Lab at U of T.
